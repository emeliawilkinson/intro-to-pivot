## Summary
PivotTables allow users to display and quickly reorganize data as needed.
Using a data set of example purchase orders, this guide explains how to create a table recognized by Excel and transform it into a PivotTable for clear and effective analysis.

## Overview
The sample data selected for this introduction to PivotTables has the following fields: 

* Order date
* Region
* Sales representative
* Item sold
* Number of units sold
* Cost per unit
* Total sale value

In order for Excel to create a PivotTable, the user must complete several steps.

First, a table must be created from the given data.
Next, the data in the new table must be formatted to correctly reflect the units that it represents.
Finally, the formatted table is used to generate a PivotTable, allowing users to quickly change the way that they view and analyze their data.

Once the PivotTable is complete, users may edit and arrange the PivotTable to meet the specifications of their project depending on their individual analytical needs.
If the data in the initial table is updated, the PivotTable can be refreshed to reflect those updates as needed.
